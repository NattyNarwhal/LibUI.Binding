# LibUI.Binding

This is a .NET wrapper library around [libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui), a portable GUI library. These should be more .NET-idiomatic.

## Status

* **Doesn't work.** Controls don't seem to be made properly/handles get fscked for setting children.
* Events need to be handled.
* Finish up the rest of the structs and functions.
