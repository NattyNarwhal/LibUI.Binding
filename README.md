# LibUI.Binding

This is a .NET wrapper library around [libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui), a portable GUI library. These should be more .NET-idiomatic.

## Status

* [X] Events need to be handled.
* [ ] Finish up the rest of the structs and functions.
* [ ] Better handle disposing of objects and loose ones
* [ ] Set up DLL mapping (i.e: use `.so` on *nix, `.dll` on Windows)
